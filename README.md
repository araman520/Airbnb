Airbnb: A Boston-Seattle story!

## Installation

This project does not require any libraries outside Anaconda. Python 3 was used for this project.

## Project Motivation

We compare the Airbnb data for Boston and Seattle to answer the following 3 questions

1. How did the price of the Airbnbs change over time?
2. What are the most expensive neighborhoods in each city?
3. What are the most important property features that drive Airbnb prices?

## File Descriptions

The Jupyter notebook has all the code and the explanation of the flow necessary for this project.

## Interacting with this project

Running the Jupyter notebook will answer the questions posted above, and you can read the post about my findings [here](https://medium.com/@araman520/airbnb-a-boston-seattle-story-6bb52ebb56bc).
